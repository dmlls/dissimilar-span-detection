I will give you some sentences below, each of them separated by a newline. Your task is to modify spans of text. The modified spans can either the same meaning as the original, or an opposite meaning.  Please, annotate your spans in both the original and the modified sentence with the characters `{{` for the beginning of a span, and `}}` for its ending. Also, try to replace spans containing more than one word. For example:

Input 1:
"Thinking about it, the issue might be more critical than what we first thought."

Output 1:
"Thinking about it, the issue {{might be more critical}} than what we {{first}} thought." => "Thinking about it, the issue {{is less relevant}} than what we {{initially}} thought."

Input 2:
"She gazed out of the window, contemplating the distant city lights twinkling in the evening darkness."

Output 2:
"She gazed {{out of the window}}, {{contemplating}} the distant city lights twinkling in the evening {{darkness}}." => "She gazed {{inside her heart}}, {{pondering}} the distant city lights twinkling in the evening {{obscurity}}."

Here are the sentences to annotate. Give me only the output as provided in the example above, and don't leave blank lines between outputs:

In the examples below, a sentence is given as input. In the output, some spans in the sentence have been marked with `{{ }}` and altered, producing a new sentence. At the end of the output, each span is annotated with a `1` or a `0` depending on whether the span in the original sentence has the same meaning or not, respectively. These numbers refer to the span as a whole, that is, there must be the same amount of numbers as spans in the sentence. Here are some examples for clarity:

Input 1:
"Thinking about it, the issue might be more critical than what we first thought."

Output 1:
"Thinking about it, the issue {{might be more critical}} than what we {{first}} thought." "Thinking about it, the issue {{is less relevant}} than what we {{initially}} thought." 0,1

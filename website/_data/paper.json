  "abstract": "**Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)** is a crucial component of many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, existing approaches typically reduce semantic nuances to a **single score**, limiting interpretability. To address this, we introduce the task of **Dissimilar Span Detection (DSD)**, which aims to identify **semantically differing spans** between pairs of texts. This can **help users understand** which particular words or tokens negatively affect the similarity score, or be used to improve performance in **STS-dependent downstream tasks**.  Furthermore, we release a new dataset suitable for the task, the **Span Similarity Dataset (SSD)**, developed through a semi-automated pipeline combining **large language models (LLMs) with human verification**. We propose and evaluate different baseline methods for DSD, both **unsupervised**—based on LIME, SHAP, LLMs, and our own method—as well as an additional **supervised** approach. While LLMs and supervised models achieve the highest performance, **overall results remain low**, highlighting the **complexity of the task**. Finally, we set up an additional experiment that shows how DSD can lead to increased performance in the specific task of **paraphrase detection**.",
